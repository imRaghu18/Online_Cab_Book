# Online Cab Booking System

## Abstract
The **Online Cab Booking System** is a digital platform designed to streamline the process of booking cabs for users and connecting them with drivers. It enables real-time booking, live tracking, fare estimation, and secure payments. The project employs agile methodologies to ensure timely delivery, adaptability, and continuous improvement.

---

## Introduction
The demand for efficient and reliable transportation has led to the development of an Online Cab Booking System. This system enables users to book rides via a mobile or web platform while providing drivers with access to potential customers. By integrating advanced features like GPS tracking, automated fare calculation, and cashless payments, the system enhances convenience and efficiency for both users and drivers.

## User Requirements and System Requirements

### User Requirements
- **Riders**:
  - Easy registration and login.
  - Booking functionality with live tracking and ETA.
  - Fare calculation and multiple payment options.
  - Ride history and feedback system.

- **Drivers**:
  - Profile management and onboarding.
  - Ride request notifications and navigation.
  - Earnings tracking and feedback from riders.

### System Requirements
- **Functional**:
  - User authentication and profile management.
  - Booking management and real-time communication.
  - Payment gateway integration.

- **Non-Functional**:
  - High availability (99.9% uptime).
  - Secure data handling and payment processing.
  - Scalability to support growing users and transactions.

## Design and Architecture
The system employs a **three-tier architecture**:
1. **Presentation Layer**:
   - Mobile app (Android/iOS) and web interface.
   - Frameworks: React, Flutter, or Angular.

2. **Business Logic Layer**:
   - APIs and backend services using Node.js, Django, or Java Spring.

3. **Data Layer**:
   - Databases: MySQL or MongoDB.
   - Integration with third-party APIs like Google Maps for GPS tracking.

### Key Features:
- Microservices architecture for scalability.
- Secure API gateways for user and driver interactions.

---

## Development (Iterations/Sprints)
The project follows Agile development with iterative sprints:
1. **Sprint 1**: User authentication and registration.
2. **Sprint 2**: Booking functionality and fare calculation.
3. **Sprint 3**: GPS tracking and map integration.
4. **Sprint 4**: Payment gateway and driver earnings summary.
5. **Sprint 5**: Testing, debugging, and deployment readiness.

---

## Testing and Feedback
- **Unit Testing**: Validation of individual components.
- **Integration Testing**: Verifying interaction between modules.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Ensuring the system meets user needs.
- **Load Testing**: Simulating high traffic conditions for performance evaluation.

---

## Deployment
Deployment occurs in stages:
1. **Beta Release**: Limited rollout for feedback and refinement.
2. **Production Deployment**: Full-scale deployment with monitoring tools.
3. **Continuous Deployment**: Regular updates for improvements and bug fixes.

---

## Maintenance and Continuous Improvement
- **Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for system uptime and issues.
